#' Proportion: Let x denote the number of successes in n independent Bernoulli trials with
#' X ~ Binomial (n, p) then phat  = x/n denotes the sample proportion.
#' @keywords internal
#' @section Introduction:
#' Objective of this package is to present interval estimation procedures for 'p'
#' outlined above in a more comprehensive way.Quality assessment procedures such as statistic
#' based on coverage probability, Expected length, Error, p-confidence and p-bias are also included.
#' Also, an array of Bayesian computations (Bayes factor, Empirical Bayesian,
#' Posterior predictive computation, and posterior probability) with conjugate prior are made available.
#' The proportion package provides three categories of important functions:
#' \strong{Confidence Intervals}, \strong{metrics on confidence intrvals} (coverage probability, length, p-confidence and
#' p-bias, error and long term power) and \strong{other methods} (hypothesis
#' testing and general/simulation methods).
#' @section Proportion methods grouping:
#' For finding confidence interval for p we have included
#' \itemize{
#' \item  Methods based on the asymptotic normality of the sample proportion and
#' estimating standard error
#' \item  Exact methods based on inverting equal-tailed binomial tests of H0 : p = p0,
#' \item  Methods based on likelihood ratios
#' \item  Bayesian approaches with beta priors or other suitable priors.}
#' @section Proportion function naming convention:
#' The general guideline for finding functions are given below:
#' \itemize{
#' \item Short names for concepts: ci - Confidence Interval, covp - Coverage Probability,
#' expl - Expected length (simulation), length - Sum of length, pCOpBI - p-Confidence and p-Bias,
#' err - Error and long term power
#' \item Short names for methods: AS - ArcSine, LR - Likelihood Ratio, LT - Logit Wald,
#' SC - Score (also know as Wilson), TW - Wald-T, WD - Wald, BA - Bayesian and
#' EX - Exact in general form that includes Mid-P and Clopper-Pearson.
#' \item For adjusted methods "A" is added to the function name while "C" will be added if it is
#' continuity corrected.
#' \item For generic functions BAF - Bayesian Factor, SIM - Simulation, GEN - Generic, PRE - Predicted,
#' POS - Posterior
#' \item Combining the above you should be able to identify the function. For example,
#' function for coverage probability (covp) using ArcSine (AS) method will be covpAS(). If we need
#' the adjusted coverage probability (covp) using ArcSine (AS) method, then it will be covpAAS().
#' \item	Wherever possible, results are consolidated for all
#' \code{x (0,1...n)} and specific \code{x}
#' (function name succeeds with \code{x}). For example, if we run \code{ciAS(n=5, alp=0.05)}
#' the output of \code{x=5} will be the same as
#' \code{ciASx(x=5, n=5,alp=0.05)}.
#' In the first case the output is printed for all the values of \code{x} till \code{x=n}.
#' \item All refers to six approximate methods (Wald, Score, Likelihood Ratio, ArcSine,
#' Logit Wald and Wald-T) - AAll (Adjusted All) refers to six  methods adjusted with
#' adding factor \code{h} (Wald, Score, Likelihood Ratio, ArcSine, Logit Wald and Wald-T)
#' \item CAll (Continuity corrected All) refers to five methods (Wald, Score, ArcSine,
#' Logit Wald and Wald-T) with continuity correction \code{c}
#' \item Grouping functions for plots end with "g" (PlotciAllxg is the same as PlotciAllx,
#' except the results are grouped by x)
#' \item For almost all the functions, corrosponding plot function is implemented,
#' which plots the output in an apporiate graph. For example, the function
#' \code{covpAll()} will give the numeric output for the
#' coverage probability of the six approximate methods (see explanation of All above).
#' Prefixing this with Plot makes it
#' \code{PlotcovpAll()}
#' and will display the plot for the same six approximate methods.}
#' @section Reproducibility of reference papers:
#' To help the researcher reproduce results in existing papers we have taken six key papers
#' (see references below) [3], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12] and reproduced the results and
#' suggested further
#' items to try. Details are in the vignette.
