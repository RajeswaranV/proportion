}
\description{
Plots graph of simulation based Coverage Probability with simulated p in [0,1]
}
\details{
Graphical evaluation of intervals obtained from any method using
coverage probability, root mean square statistic, and the proportion of
proportion lies within the desired level of coverage for the \eqn{n + 1} intervals
and pre-defined space for the parameter \code{p} using Monte Carle simulation
