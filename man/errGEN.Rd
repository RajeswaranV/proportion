\title{Calculates error, long term power and pass/fail criteria for CI obtained from any method}
\usage{
errGEN(n, LL, UL, alp, phi, f)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{- Number of trials}

\item{LL}{- Lower limit}

\item{UL}{- Upper limit}

\item{alp}{- Alpha value (significance level required)}

\item{phi}{- Null hypothesis value}

\item{f}{- Failure criterion}
}
\value{
A dataframe with
 \item{delalp}{ Delta-alpha is the increase of the nominal error with respect to real error}
 \item{theta}{ Long term power of the test}
 \item{Fail_Pass}{Fail/pass based on the input f criterion}
}
\description{
Calculates error, long term power and pass/fail criteria for CI obtained from any method
}
\details{
Evaluation of intervals obtained from any method using error due to
the difference of achieved and nominal level of significance for the \eqn{n + 1} intervals
}
