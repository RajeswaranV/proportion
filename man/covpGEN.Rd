\description{
General Coverage Probability given hypothetical "p" Coverage probability for CI
obtained from any method and discrete hypothetical p
}
\details{
Evaluation of intervals obtained from any method using
coverage probability, root mean square statistic, and the proportion of proportion
lies within the desired level of coverage for the \eqn{n + 1} intervals and pre-defined
space for the parameter \code{p}
