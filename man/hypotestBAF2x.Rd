\title{Bayesain Hypothesis testing given x: Hypothesis 2: Theta = Theta0 Vs Theta > Theta0}
\usage{
hypotestBAF2x(x, n, th0, a1, b1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{- Number of success}

\item{n}{- Number of trials from data}

\item{th0}{- Hypothetical parameter for H0}

\item{a1}{- Priors for hypothesis H1}

\item{b1}{- Priors for hypothesis H1}
}
\value{
A dataframe with
 \item{x}{ Number of successes}
 \item{BaFa01}{ Bayesian Factor}
}
\description{
Bayesain Hypothesis testing given x: Hypothesis 2: Theta = Theta0 Vs Theta > Theta0
}
\details{
Computes Bayes factor under Beta-Binomial model for the
model: \eqn{p = p0} Vs \eqn{p > p0} from the given number of
trials \code{n} and and for given number
of successes \eqn{x = 0, 1, 2......n }
We use the following guideline for reporting the results:
\itemize{
\item  1/3 <= BaFa01 < 1: Evidence against H0 is not worth more than a bare mention.
\item  1/20 <= BaFa01 < 1/3: Evidence against H0 is positive.
\item  1/150 <= BaFa01 < 1/20: Evidence against H0 is strong.
\item  BaFa10 < 1/150: Evidence against H0 is very strong.
\item  1 <= BaFa01 < 3: Evidence against H1 is not worth more than a bare mention.
\item  3 <= BaFa01 < 20: Evidence against H1 is positive.
\item  20 <= BaFa01 < 150: Evidence against H1 is strong.
\item  150 <= BaFa01: Evidence against H1 is very strong.}
