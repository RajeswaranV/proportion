\usage{
lengthGEN(n, LL, UL, hp)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{- Number of trials}

\item{LL}{- Lower limit}

\item{UL}{- Upper limit}

\item{hp}{- Hypothetical "p"}
}
\value{
A dataframe with
 \item{sumLen}{  The sum of the expected length}
 \item{explMean}{  The mean of the expected length}
 \item{explSD}{  The Standard Deviation of the expected length}
 \item{explMax}{  The max of the expected length}
 \item{explLL}{  The Lower limit of the expected length calculated using mean - SD}
