# proportion
R package for proportion

Multiple procedures to obtain an interval estimate for an unknown
proportion (p) based on binomial sampling. It is known that approximations
are poor when the true p is close to zero or to one. So we provide alternative
procedures with better properties. Non-iterative methods widely discussed
in litrature for computing a (central) two-sided interval estimate for p are
implemented in terms of coverage probability and expected length.
