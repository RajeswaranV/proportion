## Introduction
Let x denote the number of successes in n independent Bernoulli trials with X ~ Binomial (n, p) then  $\hat p = x/n$ denotes the sample proportion. Single binomial proportion (p) has drawn appreciable research attention with theoretical, applied, and pedagogic objectives. Such interest has been intensified further when Classical, Bayesian, and Bootstrap approaches are providing candidate intervals to enrich this literature. Specifically,

- M. Thulin, (2014 a, b), W. Wang (2014), B. Lecoutre and J. Poitevineau (2014), Wei Yu (2012), Zhou, X. H., Li, C.M. and Yang, Z (2008) - Aiming to improve methods methodologically
- K. Breitung and MA. Maes (2015), AM. Andres and MA. Hernandez (2014, 2015), V. RG. Newcombe (2011), C. Damgaard and A. Fayolle (2011), Tuyl F, Gerlach R and Mengersen K (2008), Vos PW and Hudson S (2005), Reiczigel J (2003), Pires (2002) - Comparison of methods with one or two evaluation metrics
- Pradhan, JC. Evans and T. Banerjee (2013), Newcombe RG (2007), Lewis JR and Sauro J (2006), Sauro J and Lewis JR (2005), Bolboaca S and Cadariu AA (2003), Henderson M and Meyer MC (2001) - Application in various fields and recommendations for teaching practices.

This package has identified scope to collate widely or frequently used methods involved in the inferential problems regarding p and prominent procedures for comparing in terms of their performance. This includes two major statistical paradigms, Classical and Bayesian; especially, later provides a list of tools to broaden this scope.


Methods for finding confidence interval for p include methods

1. Based on the asymptotic normality of the sample proportion and estimating standard error,
2. Exact methods based on inverting equal-tailed binomial tests of $H_0 : p = p_0$,
3. Methods based on likelihood ratios 
4. Bayesian approaches with beta priors or other suitable priors. 

Apart from this testing of hypotheses involving p and measures based on posterior in Bayesian approach have drawn active research interest.   

Objective of this package is to present interval estimation procedures for 'p' outlined above in a more comprehensive way. Performance assessment of these procedures such as coverage probability, Expected length, Error, p-confidence and p-bias are included. Also, an array of Bayesian computations (Bayes factor, Empirical Bayesian, Posterior predictive computation, and posterior probability) with conjugate prior is made available. More importantly package has aimed to complement the summaries using more appropriate graphical forms that enhance the presentation and teaching activities. 


## Workflow
Following Figure depicts the way this inferential problem can be understood so as to expand the scope of computations; **bold face** indicates modification of existing procedures or addition of new procedures such as t-distribution based Wald method that are not available for wider audience.

###Paper 1 (Newcombe 1998):
The paper has compared seven methods (Wald, Wald continuity corrected, Likelihood ratio, Score (Wilson), Score, continuity corrected, Clopper Pearson, Mid-P) for Two-sided confidence intervals for the single proportion. Evaluation criteria, Average CP, Aberrations, Zero Width Interval and Non Coverage aspects are considered. Four illustrative data sets have also been provided
	The package, proportion provides a more comprehensive way of summarizing results similar to the above studies; for example, a function $(ciAllx for n = 20, x = 0)$ from the package yields an easily comparable summary (numerical and graphical) together with other useful measures like existence of aberration, zero width intervals (ZWI). ArcSine and Wald-t methods are additional inclusions; Summaries / Methods which are not readily available elsewhere such as opting with Exact method in a more general way (ciEXx), continuity corrected (ciCAllx), or adding pseudo constants (ciAAllx) in a more general way or Quantile (Q) based and Highest Posterior (H) based CI from Bayesian conjugate method (ciBAx) with an option for specifying any plausible value for the two parameters of prior beta distribution.

In the case of other evaluation criteria, package proportion provides ample scope for comparing competing methods. Following table and plots illustrate for n = 250 (inspired from n = 263) using the functions $covpAll(n,alp,a1,b1)$ and $PlotcovpAll(n,alp,a1,b1)$

###Paper 2 (Joseph and Reinfold 2005):
A tutorial kind of article pertaining to obtain CI based on inverting two tailed tests involving single proportion is available in Joseph and Reinfold 2005. This mainly deals with Wald large sample and Exact methods for CI and hypothesis testing involving values near boundary of p. Only interval for Wald is avialble in the paper however, comparison of procedure would enhance the presentation and purpose. One way is through a pictorial output can be improved further by sorting the CI for each  $x = 0, 1,..,n$ using a function $PlotciAllg(n,alp)$.

```{r, echo=TRUE, results='asis'}
# 21. Paper 2 - display the function
PlotciAllg(n=10,alp=0.05)
```

Further, one of the significant features of the package is readily available Bayesian testing alternatives involving single binomial proportion (p). For example data from this paper involves a classical testing $H_0: p \le 0.9$ vs. $H_1: p > 0.9$, Bayes factor can be calculated using the function $hypotestBAF4(x,n,th0,a0,b0,a1,b1)$. (Six functions are available for the exhaustive possibilities of testing hypotheses on p). Numerical result for this data under the assumption that uniform and Jeffreys prior for null and alternate models respectively is 0.0832, which is evident to reject $H_0$.

Additionally this package has an option (like hypotestBAF4) to compare Bayes factor for all possible values of x (such as the one listed below) so as to understand the possible change in the values of Bayes factor in turn the decision.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# 20. Paper 2 - display the function
hypotestBAF4(n=10, th0=0.9, a0=1,b0=1,a1=0.5,b1=0.5)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
# 21. Paper 2

knitr::kable(Paper2.1,caption = "Hypothesis test, H0: p <= 0.9 vs. H1: p > 0.9")
```


###Paper 3 (Zhou et al 2008) and 4 (Wei Yu et al 2012):
The main objective of Zhou et al 2008 is to improve logit Wald method and the method has been illustrated with $x = 16$ and $n = 17$. Similarly, Wei Yu et al 2012 have attempted an improvement for Score method with a real data example ($x = 16, n = 109$). Further, two adjustment methods can easily be compared with other adjustment methods using the options available from the package ciAAllx. Intentionally the adjustment factor (h) is taken as zero to compare with original results of respective studies.  Such comparison is pervasive in a statistical investigation involving a parameter, particularly for p.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# 20. Function to evaluate ci varying the adding constant h
ciAAllx(x=16, n=17,alp = 0.05,h=0)
ciAAllx(x=16, n=109,alp = 0.05,h=0)
```

The full results are shown below with $h$ values of 0,1 and 2.
```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
# 21. Paper 3&4
Paper2.2=ciAAllx(x=16, n=17,alp = 0.05,h=0)
Paper2.3=ciAAllx(x=16, n=109,alp = 0.05,h=0)
Paper2.4=ciAAllx(x=16, n=17,alp = 0.05,h=1)
Paper2.5=ciAAllx(x=16, n=109,alp = 0.05,h=1)
Paper2.6=ciAAllx(x=16, n=17,alp = 0.05,h=2)
Paper2.7=ciAAllx(x=16, n=109,alp = 0.05,h=2)
knitr::kable(Paper2.2,caption = "CI with x=16, n=17 & h=0")
knitr::kable(Paper2.3,caption = "CI with x=16, n=109 & h=0")
knitr::kable(Paper2.4,caption = "CI with x=16, n=17 & h=1")
knitr::kable(Paper2.5,caption = "CI with x=16, n=109 & h=1")
knitr::kable(Paper2.6,caption = "CI with x=16, n=17 & h=2")
knitr::kable(Paper2.7,caption = "CI with x=16, n=109 & h=2")
```

To compare the length of the intervals for the data $x = 16, n = 17$, a graphical form can be obtained from the package using 
```{r, echo=TRUE, results='asis'}
# 21. Paper 3&4 - Plot of all the adjusted CI with h=1
PlotciAAllxg(x=16,n=17,alp=0.05,h=1)
```

As can be seen above the grouping function (ending with g) convinently orders the results within each value of x.

Another aspect is the way Exact method has been handled; based on the extensive studies for adjusting Exact method, this package confines to randomized test using the constant e in [0, 1]. Example 6 (Joseph and Reinfold 2005- see table above)  may be reproduced with the function ciEXx as shown below.
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# 22. Paper 3&4 - display the function
ciEXx(x=98, n=100,alp = 0.05,e=c(0.1,.5,0.95,1))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
# 23. Paper 3&4
Paper3.2=ciEXx(x=98, n=100,alp = 0.05,e=c(0.1,.5,0.95,1))
knitr::kable(Paper3.2,caption = "CI-Exact with x=98, n=100")
```

###Paper 5 (Tuyl et al 2008):
This paper has compared difference non-informative priors with an informative prior based on an earlier study for single binomial proportion with a real data set $x = 0, n = 167$. This is one of most often cited examples for zero successes which have witnessed active research. The predictive density based comparison has been carried out to emphasize a specific prior assumption. This package provides readily available options in Bayesian computation using posterior predictive distributions for a wider comparison and probabilities. A quick comparison using Uniform prior for zero successes or possibility for $p = 0.5$ can be explored using the function $probPREx(x,n,xnew,m,a1,a2)$. The variable xnew and m varies, keeping x=0, n=167, a1=a2=1.
```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}

Assuming that the example depicts a rare event, an analysis with posterior probabilities would enhance the analysis when the function $probPOSx(x,n,a,b,th)$ is used

Also literature often compiles the frequentist evaluation criteria for Bayesian methods too and hence this package includes most prominent methods as well as other measures as a sign of enlarging the scope of comparison.
